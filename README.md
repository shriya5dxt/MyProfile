## Website description
### Home

This page of my webiste is the homepage. I have added a short description of myself and my aspirations. I have added navbar where we can see all the items like Home,about,portfolio and contact. Some tags which can be highlighted are:

* **fontawesome** -  For my ease I have used Font Awesome which is the Internet's icon library and toolkit, used by millions of designers, developers, and content creators. I have used different icons for my navigation bar.
* **nav** - Defines a set of navigation links where we can navigate to different section of the webiste like about, portfolio etc.
* **section** - I have used section tag to create different sections for my image and also the content.
* **aboutme** - About me btn redirects me to about me page which I have explained below. 


It contains the following bootstrap components:

1) dropdown: In the nav menu for the "more" to navigate to different pages.
2) form: I have added form for my contact information.
3) button: They are used for ordering online, sending a message.
4) card: for different work I have used cards to show different projects.
5) form-group: I used this to show contact information.
6) card-title: Card titles are used by adding .card-title to a <h*> tag. In the same way, links are added and placed next to each other by adding .card-link to an <a> tag.
7) container-fluid: I used .container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport. in about me section.
8)img-fluid - used in the first page for the image.
9) Footer: Card footers can be styled by adding .card-footer to <h*> elements.here I have added for my contact information.
10) list-group - I have used list items to put my educational details.List groups are a flexible and powerful component for displaying a series of content. Modify and extend them to support just about any content within.
11)alert: I have also added alert to click on more options.

### About me

This section covers all my personal information such as name mail, skills and education. 
The navigation bar is always the same for all the pages. Some tags which I have added are:

* **downloadbtn** - I gave href as pdf file. So when a user clicks he/she can automatically download the pdf.
* **skills** - For the cards in the skills section I have added different references links for my certifications.
* **education** - I have added a border in css file for the extra effect.


### Contact

Finally, this page let's the user connect with me via email or telephone. Features of HTML like tel and mailto in href tells the browser how to use the number.The number within the quotes is the number it will call. similarly with mailto option the default email app on the user's computer opens and suggests sending a message to the email address mentioned in the Mailto link.

All input elements are covered by the contact page. Using attribute selectors, you can only style a specific input type. I have used input[type=number] and input[type=text] for the phone number and text message.
